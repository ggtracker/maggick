Crazy AutoIT script that attempts to automatically render out a full idle animation of every unit in SC2 in the editor!

I've used this to create the animated gifs and also extracted frames from it for cooler/larger unit icons.

You'll need autoit/windows for it: http://www.autoitscript.com and change the script up a little, there are hardcoded paths in there and whatnot.

Then, if you have that running, you can use the shell/rb scripts to generate animated gifs/etc from the created videos.
